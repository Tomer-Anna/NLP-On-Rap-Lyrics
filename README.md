# NLP-On-Rap-Lyrics

At this project, I focused on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and unsupervised learning. 
I'm going to use NLP to analyze a large list of rap artists by their song lyrics and try to find interesting insights with tish data. 
I chose to focus on rap music because, unlike some other type of music like jazz, electronic, or even pop, 
rap music heavily relying on lyrics so NLP techniques can be useful. 

In addition, I will try to build a Recommendation System that takes a rapper name input from the user and provide a 
recommendations of 5 other rappers that the user might be love as well, based on "rappers closeness" in terms of lyrics

## Import Libraries
 - import relevat libraries.
 
## Getting + Cleaning The Data

In this section we are going to:
 - Import the data. 
 - Clean the data round 1.
 - Organizing the data. 
 - Clean the data round 2. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here we are try to answer:
 - Which rapper swears the most? 
 - Which rappers use the largest vocabulary? 
 - What are the most common words? 

And do a visualization with word cloud 

## Sentiment Analysis

In this part we will see which rapper are more positive and which are negative.

## Recommendation System

 - The model. 
 - Preprocessing.
 - How to check if it is a good result?
